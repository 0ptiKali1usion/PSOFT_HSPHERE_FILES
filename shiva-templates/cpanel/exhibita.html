            <P>1. AGREEMENT. In this Registration Agreement ("Agreement") "you" 
            and "your" refer to each customer, "we", us" and "our" refer to 
            Tucows.com Inc. and "Services" refers to the domain name 
            registration provided by us as offered through _________, Inc, the 
            Registration Service Provider ("RSP"). This Agreement explains our 
            obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us for various 
            Services.</P>
            <P>2. SELECTION OF A DOMAIN NAME. You represent that, to the best of 
            the your knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the SLD 
            name nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly used 
            infringes the legal rights of a third party and that the Domain Name 
            is not being registered for any unlawful purpose.</P>
            <P>3. FEES. As consideration for the services you have selected, you 
            agree to pay to us, or your respective RSP who remits payment to us 
            on your behalf, the applicable service(s) fees. All fees payable 
            hereunder are non-refundable. As further consideration for the 
            Services, you agree to: (1) provide certain current, complete and 
            accurate information about you as required by the registration 
            process and (2) maintain and update this information as needed to 
            keep it current, complete and accurate. All such information shall 
            be referred to as account information ("Account Information"). You, 
            by completing and submitting this Agreement represent that the 
            statements in your application are true.</P>
            <P>4. TERM. You agree that the Registration Agreement will remain in 
            full force during the length of the term of your Domain Name 
            Registration. Should you choose to renew or otherwise lengthen the 
            term of your Domain Name Registration, then the term of this 
            Registration Agreement will be extended accordingly. This Agreement 
            will remain in full force during the length of the term of your 
            Domain Name Registration as selected, recorded, and paid for upon 
            registration of the Domain Name. Should you choose to renew or 
            otherwise lengthen the term of your Domain Name Registration, then 
            the term of this Registration Agreement will be extended 
            accordingly. Should you transfer your domain name or should the 
            domain name otherwise be transferred due to another Registrar, the 
            terms and conditions of this contract shall cease and shall be 
            replaced by the contractual terms in force for the purpose of 
            registering domain names then in force between SLD holders and the 
            new Registrar.</P>
            <P>5. MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT. You agree, during the period of 
            this Agreement, that we may: (1) revise the terms and conditions of 
            this Agreement; and (2) change the services provided under this 
            Agreement. Any such revision or change will be binding and effective 
            immediately on posting of the revised Agreement or change to the 
            service(s) on our web site, or on notification to you by e-mail or 
            regular mail as per the Notices section of this agreement. You agree 
            to review our web site, including the Agreement, periodically to be 
            aware of any such revisions. If you do not agree with any revision 
            to the Agreement, you may terminate this Agreement at any time by 
            providing us with notice by e-mail or regular mail as per the 
            Notices section of this agreement. Notice of your termination will 
            be effective on receipt and processing by us. You agree that, by 
            continuing to use the Services following notice of any revision to 
            this Agreement or change in service(s), you shall abide by any such 
            revisions or changes. You further agree to abide by the ICANN 
            Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy ("Dispute Policy") as amended from 
            time to time. You agree that, by maintaining the reservation or 
            registration of your domain name after modifications to the Dispute 
            Policy become effective, you have agreed to these modifications. You 
            acknowledge that if you do not agree to any such modifications, you 
            may request that your domain name be deleted from the domain name 
            database.</P>
            <P>6. MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. In order to change any of your 
            account information with us, you must use your Account Identifier 
            and Password that you selected when you opened your account with us. 
            Please safeguard your Account Identifier and Password from any 
            unauthorized use. In no event will we be liable for the unauthorized 
            use or misuse of your Account Identifier or Password.</P>
            <P>7. DOMAIN NAME DISPUTE POLICY. If you reserved or registered a 
            domain name through us, or transferred a domain name to us from 
            another registrar, you agree to be bound by the Dispute Policy which 
            is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement by 
            reference. The current version of the Dispute Policy may be found at 
            <A 
            href="http://www.opensrs.org/legal/udrp.shtml">http://www.opensrs.org/legal/udrp.shtml</A>. 
            Please take the time to familiarize yourself with this policy.</P>
            <P>8. DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES. You agree that, if the registration or 
            reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you 
            will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in 
            effect at the time of the dispute. You agree that in the event a 
            domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify 
            and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained 
            in the Dispute Policy. For any dispute, you agree to submit to the 
            jurisdiction of the courts of The Province of Ontario.</P>
            <P>9. ICANN POLICY. You agree that your registration of the SLD name 
            shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant 
            to any ICANN-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or 
            registry procedure not inconsistent with an ICANN-adopted policy, 
            (1) to correct mistakes by Registrar or the Registry in registering 
            the name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning the SLD 
            name.</P>
            <P>10. AGENCY. Should you intend to license use of a domain name to 
            a third party you shall nonetheless be the SLD holder of record and 
            are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact 
            information and for providing and updating accurate technical and 
            administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely 
            resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the SLD. 
            You shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the 
            SLD, unless you promptly disclose the identity of the licensee to 
            the party providing you reasonable evidence of actionable harm. You 
            also represent that you have provided notice of the terms and 
            conditions in this Agreement to the third party and that the third 
            party agrees to the terms of Disclosure and Use of Registration 
            Information (sections 18 and 19 of this Agreement).</P>
            <P>11. ANNOUNCEMENTS. We and the RSP reserve the right to distribute 
            information to you that is pertinent to the quality or operation of 
            our services and those of our service partners. These announcements 
            will be predominately informative in nature and may include notices 
            describing changes, upgrades, new products or other information to 
            add security or to enhance your identity on the Internet.</P>
            <P>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. You agree that our entire liability, 
            and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Services(s) provided 
            under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely 
            limited to the amount you paid for such Service(s). We and our 
            contractors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, 
            incidental, special or consequential damages resulting from the use 
            or inability to use any of the Services or for the cost of 
            procurement of substitute services. Because some states do not allow 
            the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or 
            incidental damages, in such states, our liability is limited to the 
            extent permitted by law. We disclaim any and all loss or liability 
            resulting from, but not limited to: (1) loss or liability resulting 
            from access delays or access interruptions; (2) loss or liability 
            resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3) loss or 
            liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or liability 
            resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account 
            identifier or password; (5) loss or liability resulting from errors, 
            omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or 
            services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or liability 
            resulting from the interruption of your Service. You agree that we 
            will not be liable for any loss of registration and use of your 
            domain name, or for interruption of business, or any indirect, 
            special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind (including 
            lost profits) regardless of the form of action whether in contract, 
            tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been 
            advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall our 
            maximum liability exceed five hundred ($500.00) dollars.</P>
            <P>13. INDEMNITY. You agree to release, indemnify, and hold us, our 
            contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates 
            harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including 
            without limitation Network Solutions, Inc., and the directors, 
            officers, employees and agents of each of them, including attorney's 
            fees, of third parties relating to or arising under this Agreement, 
            the Services provided hereunder or your use of the Services, 
            including without limitation infringement by you, or someone else 
            using the Service with your computer, of any intellectual property 
            or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the 
            violation of any of our operating rules or policy relating to the 
            service(s) provided. You also agree to release, indemnify and hold 
            us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the 
            Dispute Policy. When we are threatened with suit by a third party, 
            we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to 
            indemnify us; your failure to provide those assurances may be 
            considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in 
            deactivation of your domain name.</P>
            <P>14. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP. The person named as administrative 
            contact at the time the controlling user name and password are 
            secured shall be the owner of the domain name. You agree that prior 
            to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person (the 
            Transferee") you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing 
            to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Your 
            domain name will not be transferred until we receive such written 
            assurances or other reasonable assurance that the Transferee has 
            been bound by the contractual terms of this Agreement (such 
            reasonable assurance as determined by us in our sole discretion) 
            along with the applicable transfer fee. If the Transferee fails to 
            be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our sole 
            discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such 
            transfer will be null and void.</P>
            <P>15. BREACH. You agree that failure to abide by any provision of 
            this Agreement, any operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy 
            provided by us, may be considered by us to be a material breach and 
            that we may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to you. 
            If within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of such notice, you 
            fail to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to us, 
            that you have not breached your obligations under the Agreement, 
            then we may delete the registration or reservation of your domain 
            name. Any such breach by you shall not be deemed to be excused 
            simply because we did not act earlier in response to that, or any 
            other breach by you.</P>
            <P>16. NO GUARANTY. You agree that, by registration or reservation 
            of your chosen domain name, such registration or reservation does 
            not confer immunity from objection to either the registration, 
            reservation, or use of the domain name.</P>
            <P>17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. You agree that your use of our 
            Services is solely at your own risk. You agree that such Service(s) 
            is provided on an "as is," "as available" basis. We expressly 
            disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, 
            including but not limited to the implied warranties of 
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and 
            non-infringement. We make no warranty that the Services will meet 
            your requirements, or that the Service(s) will be uninterrupted, 
            timely, secure, or error free; nor do we make any warranty as to the 
            results that may be obtained from the use of the Service(s) or as to 
            the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the 
            Service or that defects in the Service will be corrected. You 
            understand and agree that any material and/or data downloaded or 
            otherwise obtained through the use of Service is done at your own 
            discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any 
            damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the 
            download of such material and/or data. We make no warranty regarding 
            any goods or services purchased or obtained through the Service or 
            any transactions entered into through the Service. No advice or 
            information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or 
            through the Service shall create any warranty not expressly made 
            herein.</P>
            <P>18. INFORMATION. As part of the registration process, you are 
            required to provide us certain information and to update us promptly 
            as such information changes such that our records are current, 
            complete and accurate. You are obliged to provide us the following 
            information:</P>
            <P>i) Your name and postal address (or, if different, that of the 
            domain name holder); 
            <P>ii) The domain name being registered 
            <P>iii) The name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax 
            (if available) telephone numbers of the administrative contact for 
            the domain name. 
            <P>iv) The name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax 
            (if available) telephone numbers of the billing contact for the 
            domain name. 
            <P>Any other information which we request from you at registration 
            is voluntary. Any voluntary information we request is collected such 
            that we can continue to improve the products and services offered to 
            you through your RSP.</P>
            <P>19. DISCLOSURE AND USE OF REGISTRATION INFORMATION. You agree and 
            acknowledge that we will make domain name registration information 
            you provide available to ICANN, to the registry administrators, and 
            to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or 
            permit. You further agree and acknowledge that we may make publicly 
            available, or directly available to third party vendors, some, or 
            all, of the domain name registration information you provide, for 
            purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or other 
            purposes as required or permitted by ICANN and the applicable 
            laws.</P>
            <P>You hereby consent to any and all such disclosures and use of, 
            and guidelines, limits and restrictions on disclosure or use of, 
            information provided by you in connection with the registration of a 
            domain name (including any updates to such information), whether 
            during or after the term of your registration of the domain name. 
            You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action 
            you may have arising from such disclosure or use of your domain name 
            registration information by us.</P>
            <P>You may access your domain name registration information in our 
            possession to review, modify or update such information, by 
            accessing our domain manager service, or similar service, made 
            available by us through your RSP.</P>
            <P>We will not process data about any identified or identifiable 
            natural person that we obtain from you in a way incompatible with 
            the purposes and other limitations which we describe in this 
            Agreement.</P>
            <P>We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we 
            obtain from you from our loss, misuse, unauthorized access or 
            disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information.</P>
            <P>20. REVOCATION. Your wilful provision of inaccurate or unreliable 
            information, your wilful failure promptly to update information 
            provided to us, or your failure to respond for over fifteen calendar 
            days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of contact details 
            associated with the your registration shall constitute a material 
            breach of this Agreement and be a basis for cancellation of the SLD 
            registration.</P>
            <P>21. RIGHT OF REFUSAL. We, in our sole discretion, reserve the 
            right to refuse to register or reserve your chosen domain name or 
            register you for other Services within thirty (30) calendar days 
            from receipt of your payment for such services. In the event we do 
            not register or reserve your domain name or register you for other 
            Services, or we delete your domain name or other Services within 
            such thirty (30) calendar day period, we agree to refund your 
            applicable fee(s). You agree that we shall not be liable to you for 
            loss or damages that may result from our refusal to register, 
            reserve, or delete your domain name or register you for other

            <P>22. SEVERABILITY. You agree that the terms of this Agreement are 
            severable. If any term or provision is declared invalid or 
            unenforceable, that term or provision will be construed consistent 
            with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original 
            intentions of the parties, and the remaining terms and provisions 
            will remain in full force and effect.</P>

            <P>24. NON-WAIVER. Our failure to require performance by you of any

            breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of
