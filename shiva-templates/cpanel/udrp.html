      <U>Purpose</U>.</B> This Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy 
      (the "Policy") has been adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
      Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), is incorporated by reference into your 
      Registration Agreement, and sets forth the terms and conditions in 
      connection with a dispute between you and any party other than us (the 
      registrar) over the registration and use of an Internet domain name 
      registered by you. Proceedings under <A href="#4">Paragraph 4</A> of this 
      Policy will be conducted according to the Rules for Uniform Domain Name 
      Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Rules of Procedure"), which are available 
      at <A 
      href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm">www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm</A>,

      supplemental rules.</FONT></P>

      <U>Your Representations</U>.</B> By applying to register a domain name, or 
      by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby 
      represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your 
      Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge, 
      the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise 
      violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the 
      domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use 
      the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is 
      your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration 
      infringes or violates someone else's rights.</FONT></P>

        dispute between the parties. This Administrative Panel may consolidate 
        before it any or all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided that

        Availability of Court Proceedings.</B> The mandatory administrative 
        proceeding requirements set forth in <A href="#4">Paragraph 4</A> shall 
        not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to 
        a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such 
        mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such 
        proceeding is concluded. If an Administrative Panel decides that your 
        domain name registration should be canceled or transferred, we will wait 
        ten (10) business days (as observed in the location of our principal 
        office) after we are informed by the applicable Provider of the 
        Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision. We 
        will then implement the decision unless we have received from you during 
        that ten (10) business day period official documentation (such as a copy 
        of a complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that you have 
        commenced a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which 
        the complainant has submitted under <A 
        href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm#3bxiii">Paragraph 
        3(b)(xiii)</A> of the Rules of Procedure. (In general, that jurisdiction 
        is either the location of our principal office or of your address as 
        shown in our Whois database. See <A 
        href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm#1MutualJurisdiction">Paragraphs

        of the Rules of Procedure for details.) If we receive such documentation 
        within the ten (10) business day period, we will not implement the 
        Administrative Panel's decision, and we will take no further action, 
        until we receive (i) evidence satisfactory to us of a resolution between 
        the parties; (ii) evidence satisfactory to us that your lawsuit has been 
        dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii) a copy of an order from such court

        this Policy. In the event that you transfer a domain name registration 
        to us during the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute

      Policy at any time with the permission of ICANN. We will post our revised 
      Policy at &lt;URL&gt; at least thirty (30) calendar days before it becomes 
      effective. Unless this Policy has already been invoked by the submission 
      of a complaint to a Provider, in which event the version of the Policy in 
      effect at the time it was invoked will apply to you until the dispute is 
      over, all such changes will be binding upon you with respect to any domain 
      name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose before, on or after 
      the effective date of our change. In the event that you object to a change 
      in this Policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain name 
      registration with us, provided that you will not be entitled to a refund 
      of any fees you paid to us. The revised Policy will apply to you until you 
      cancel your domain name registration.</FONT></P>
