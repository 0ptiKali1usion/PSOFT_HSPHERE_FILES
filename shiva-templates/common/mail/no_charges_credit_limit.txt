As of ${current_date} your account #${account.id.id} has ${toolbox.displayBalance(bill.balance)} on a balance.
Your balance hasn't exceeded your credit limit. Therefore there are no charges due, as of now. 
You will be charged as soon as your balance exceeds your credit limit ${account.bill.credit}.

Thank you for cooperation.

Best regards,
