As of ${current_date} your account #${account.id.id} has ${toolbox.displayBalance(bill.balance)} on a balance.
You haven't made any purchases or orders that would affect your balance and
you haven't exceeded any of your monthly resource limits either. Therefore, as
of now, there's no charges due.

Thank you for cooperation.

Best regards,
