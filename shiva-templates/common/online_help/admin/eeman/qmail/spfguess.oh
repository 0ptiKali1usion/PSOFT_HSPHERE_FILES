<br>You can specify a line with guess rules.
<br>Guess rules means: Rules that are used if the domain doesn't publish SPF rules.
<br>The local spfrules are always executed afterwards. We suggest adding  a/24 mx/24 ptr.
<br>This isn't needed but generally gives good results (for spam filters scoring Received-SPF lines).
