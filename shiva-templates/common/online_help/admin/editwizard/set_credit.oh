<center> Credit Limit </center>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Credit limit is a credit threshold. When it is reached, users can't create more pay and free resources. Reaching the credit limit will not, however, suspend the account, and the recurrent and usage fees, will still be accrued. This way, the negative balance grows with every new billing period. <br>

Besides, credit limit minimizes referrals to credit card processing centers. All fees are accrued until their cumulative amount reaches or exceeds the credit limit. Then, this total amount is charged.
