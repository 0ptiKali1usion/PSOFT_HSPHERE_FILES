<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Service Domain should be included only in the Service plan to host your <b>corporate web-site</b>, that's why <i>billing</i> is disabled for this kind of domain. <br>
<br>
<i>Service Domains</i> are fully-functional H-Sphere domains.<br>
<br>
* Service Domain is a platform independent resource. It requires neither of the <i>domain</i> resources included.
