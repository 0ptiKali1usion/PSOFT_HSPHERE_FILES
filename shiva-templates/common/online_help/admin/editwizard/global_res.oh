<br>Disabling resources for resellers works like disabling resources in end users' plans: new customers won't be able to use them; existing users won't be able to add them, but these resources will still be available to the users that already use them. 
<br>To confirm changes in reseller plans, go through Plan Edit Wizards and submit the changes without changing the prices.
