	<b>Setup:</b> single-time amount charged when reseller registers with your hosting system. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<b>Monthly: </b>recurrent fee paid at the beginning of each billing period for the account maintenance. If reseller is signed up with more than one month billing period, the recurrent fee is calculated as the product of this monthly fee and the number of months. <br><br>
<i>* These fees are flat, which means they are charged no matter how many customers and user charges resellers may have.</i>
