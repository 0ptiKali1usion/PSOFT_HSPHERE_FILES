	<i>Money Back Guarantee</i> is  the period in days after pay registration when users can get back 100% of all their recurrent fees for all resources they've used if they decide to quit hosting services. The Money Back amount does not include the Setup Fees and is not affected by the refund percentage. The blank field sets it to zero, which disables the feature.
