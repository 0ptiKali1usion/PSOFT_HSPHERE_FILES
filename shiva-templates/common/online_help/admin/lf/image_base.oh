<center>Base Image Path</center>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you can change H-Sphere standard base image path to that of your own. To do this, do the following:<br> 
1) Copy all the standard images (usually the IMAGES directory) to your custom location. If you are a reseller, try to get these images from your hosting company.<br>
2) Once you have copied the images, replace some (or all) of them with your custom ones preserving their sizes.<br>
3) Specify your custom location in the <i>Base Image Directory or URL</i> field. This location must be either a fully qualified URL of your host or a directory path relative to the CP Web Server Document Root.<br>
4) If you made a mistake and your images didn't show, just clear the <i>Base Image Directory or URL</i> field, and click <i>Submit</i>. The original path will be restored.<br>
