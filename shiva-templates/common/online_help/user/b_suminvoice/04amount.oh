<center>Amount</center>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The total amount of money charged for bought/used resources at a time. The sum is charged only when it exceeds your credit limit - for users who pay by credit cards and check-pay users whose balance exceeds the credit limit.<br>
E.g.: Although $10 for bought resources will be displayed in the chart the sum won't be charged if your credit limit is $15. Purchasing additional $10 resources you'll exceed your credit limit and therefore $20 will be charged and the bill closed.<br>
