Virtual FTP Server allows authorized Internet users to download, upload or view files in your FTP directories on the hosting server.<br>To create your Virtual FTP Server switch the <i>FTP</i> button to <i>ON</i>. Your domain name should have a dedicated IP. To obtain a dedicated IP address, go to the <i>Domain Settings</i> page and click the <i>Change to Dedicated IP</i> link. (For more details on the difference between dedicated IP and shared IP read the <i>Domain Settings</i> chapter of H-Sphere 2.0 User Guide.) Then come back to the <i>FTP</i> page. The <i> (Dedicated IP is required)&quot; text next to the <i>FTP</i> button should dissapear. Now set the toggle to ON to create your Virtual FTP Host.<br>If you already have a Virtual FTP Server you can edit its settings by clicking the <i>Edit</i> icon.<br>For more information see the <i>FTP/User Account</i> chapter of H-Sphere 2.0 User Guide.
