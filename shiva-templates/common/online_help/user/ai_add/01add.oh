With H-Sphere you can create several accounts under one login and easily switch between them after you log into the control panel. Several accounts are usual for incompatible plans. As each of your account has it's own payment intervals, different sets of resources, different prices, etc., they are charged separately. However, your billing info can be the same for all of them. For more information see <i>Using Multiple Accounts</i>, User Guide.
