A billing profile is a collection of your billing details, such as the number of your credit card or your postal address (for checks). HSphere 2.0 supports multiple billing profiles. This feature gives you an opportunity to use several credit cards in turn, activating the one you would like to be charged.<br>
Here, in case you have several billing profiles, you can select and activate one of them.
