<center>Stopgap Domain</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You can  host domains without domain names (the so-called stop-gap domains). Usually they are created when a you want to "save" some site space for the future. When you create a stopgap domain, you get no DNS zone, and you cannot use e-mail service. However, you will be able to access and manage your site using the instant domain alias.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Stopgap domains support web site management and FTP services. Also, you can have IP-only access. For this, you have to purchase a dedicated IP.
