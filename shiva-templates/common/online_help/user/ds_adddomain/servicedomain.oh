	Service Domain should be included only for the administrative plans to host and manage your corporate website. To enable users register third level domains with the second level domain name of your corporate site, register it as a service domain. For example, the company offers third level domains at <i>besthosting.com</i>, such as <i>thirdlevel.besthosting.com </i> or <i>userdomain.besthosting.com</i>. Naturally, the site of the hosting company should have the second level domain name, i.e. <i>besthosting.com. </i>
