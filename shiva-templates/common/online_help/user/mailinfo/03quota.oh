Change the quota for the mailbox. Mailbox quota is not related to the site disk space quota. To change your mail quota, enter its new size in megabytes. You will thereafter be charged for the difference between this new amount and the default free amount. This charge will automatically be added to the recurrent fee at the beginning of each payment interval.
