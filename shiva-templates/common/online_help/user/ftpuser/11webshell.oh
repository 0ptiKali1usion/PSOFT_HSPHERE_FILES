WebShell is a server-side application designed to simplify the daunting task of Unix file management for users new to the Unix system, as well as to provide a visual and easily accessible interface for the more advanced users. Because it works through the user's browser, WebShell lets you or your customers get at the needed files from virtually any computer in the world. And since it can be used with a secure web server, you do not have to sacrifice security for ease of use.
