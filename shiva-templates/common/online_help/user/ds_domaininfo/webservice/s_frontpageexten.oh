	<i>FrontPage</i> is a powerful tool to build your sites. However if you leave this feature  disabled, the system won't support the sites created with its means. To enable <i>FrontPage Extensions</i>, click the <i>ON/OFF </i>button. In the window that appears, enter the login and password you will need to upload your web pages with the FrontPage Publish Web feature. You can change FPE login and password at any time in the future by clicking the <i>Edit</i> icon that appears next to the <i>ON/OFF</i> button.
