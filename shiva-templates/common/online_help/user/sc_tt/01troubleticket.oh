The Trouble Tickets feature is a means to provide communication between you and the technical administrator. Virtually every form contains a link to the TT from where you can report on your problem. If your problem is already answered it appears in the <i>Trouble Ticket Chart</i> as a hyper text with an asterisk next to the title of your trouble ticket. Click the <i>Title</i> of the TT to view your question and the answer.
