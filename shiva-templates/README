Adding online help files to the 2nd step (prices) of the reseller wizard
========================================================================

To add online help files to other pages, you will also need to edit hsphere templates.


Preparation:
------------
1) Make a share on the demo.psoft server by adding the following line to /etc/exports:
/hsphere/local/home/cpanel/shiva        192.168.112.122/255.255.255.0(rw,all_squash,anonuid=500,anongid=500)
Then restart nfs.
2) Create a mount point on the local computer in /etc/fstab:
192.168.116.242:/hsphere/local/home/cpanel/shiva        /mnt/demo_psoft         nfs     noauto,user  0 0
create directory /mnt/demo_psoft
mount /mnt/demo_psoft as a common user (not root)


Adding Online Help Files
------------------------
1) Create an online help file.
2) Add a correspondence in /shiva/psoft/hsphere/online_help.xml following this format:
 <reference id="r__<RESOURCE_NAME>" file="<HELP_FILE>"/>
where:
  RESOURCE_NAME can be taken from the file /hsphere/psoft/hsphere/config.xml, attribute "name",
  HELP_FILE is specified with the path but without the .oh extension.
3) Copy the following files to the corresponding dirs in /mnt/demo_psoft/:
 - online help files 
 - /shiva/psoft/hsphere/online_help.xml
4) Restart H-Sphere on Demo.psoft and check the changes
5) Commit online help files and online_help.xml to CVS
