admin.CCEncryptWizardOn.instructions = Normally credit cards numbers are stored in clear text in the hsphere database. This wizard will allow the administrator to encrypt all the credit card numbers, and to control when the credit card numbers are accesable by the Control Panel. This feature uses Public/Private key encryption technology. All the credit cards will be encrypted using a Public key, that is always stored in a file on the Control Panel Server. The private key, which will be used to decrypt all the credit card numbers, will be downloaded by the administrator as part of this wizard. THE PRIVATE KEY IS NOT STORED ON DISK AND MUST BE UPLOADED EVERY TIME THE CONTROL PANEL IS RESTARTED. This wizard will take you through the process of encrypting the credit cards. The process consists of four steps, first step is to generate the Public/Private Key pair.

admin.CCEncryptWizardOn.generateKeys = Pressing next will generate the Private/Public Key pair

admin.CCEncryptWizardOn.warning = WARNING: THE PRIVATE KEY MUST BE STORED IN A SECURE AND SAFE MEDIA BY THE ADMINISTRATOR (not on any of the hsphere servers). IF THE PRIVATE KEY IS LOST, THERE IS NO WAY FOR ANYONE TO RECOVER THE CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED.

admin.regions.dt_patterns_header = Date and Time Patterns
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text1 = Date and time formats are specified by date and time pattern strings. Within date and time pattern strings, unquoted letters from \'A\' to \'Z\' and from \'a\' to \'z\' are interpreted as pattern letters representing the components of a date or time string. Text can be quoted using single quotes \(\'\) to avoid interpretation. \"\'\'\" represents a single quote. All other characters are not interpreted; they\'re simply copied into the output string during formatting or matched against the input string during parsing.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text2 = The following pattern letters are defined \(all other characters from \'A\' to \'Z\' and from \'a\' to \'z\' are reserved\)\:
admin.regions.dt_patterns_letter = Letter
admin.regions.dt_patterns_component = Date or Time Component
admin.regions.dt_patterns_presentation = Presentation
admin.regions.dt_patterns_example = Examples
admin.regions.dt_patterns_era = Era designator
admin.regions.dt_patterns_txt = Text
admin.regions.dt_patterns_y = Year
admin.regions.dt_patterns_m_y = Month in year
admin.regions.dt_patterns_m = Month
admin.regions.dt_patterns_w_y = Week in year
admin.regions.dt_patterns_number = Number
admin.regions.dt_patterns_w_m = Week in month
admin.regions.dt_patterns_gtz = General time zone
admin.regions.dt_patterns_rfc_tz = RFC 822 time zone
admin.regions.dt_patterns_d_m = Day in month
admin.regions.dt_patterns_d_w_m = Day of week in month

admin.regions.dt_patterns_h_am1 = Hour in am/pm \(1-12\)
admin.regions.dt_patterns_m_h = Minute in hour
admin.regions.dt_patterns_s_m = Second in minute
admin.regions.dt_patterns_ms = Millisecond
admin.regions.dt_patterns_tz = Time zone
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text3 = Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the exact presentation\:
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_txt = Text:  For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form is used if available. For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number of pattern letters.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_number = Number:  For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount. For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless it's needed to separate two adjacent fields.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_year1 = Year:  For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a number.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_year2 = For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2, the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of digits. So using the pattern \"MM\/dd\/yyyy\", \"01\/11\/12\" parses to Jan 11, 12 A.D.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_year3 = For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern \(\"y\" or \"yy\"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat  instance is created. For example, using a pattern of \"MM\/dd\/yy\" and a SimpleDateFormat instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string \"01\/11\/12\" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string \"05\/04\/64\" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964. During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by Character.isDigit\(char\), will be parsed into the default century. Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit string, or a two digit string that isn\'t all digits \(for example, \"-1\"\), is interpreted literally. So \"01\/02\/3\" or \"01\/02\/003\" are parsed, using the same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, \"01\/02\/-3\" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_month = Month:  If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is interpreted as text; otherwise, it is interpreted as a number.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_tz1 = General time zone:  Time zones are interpreted as text if they have names.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_text_rfc_tz1 = RFC 822 time zone:  For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used.
admin.regions.dt_patterns_txt_xmpl1 = Tuesday; Tue
admin.regions.dt_patterns_txt_xmpl2 = Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00

One of them will be readable by the POP3 User configured below, and the other one is used for an archived copy.<br>Configure POP3 settings so the system can pickup such e-mails and automatically convert them to Trouble Tickets. Once the settings are correct, the system will start checking POP3 box for new messages.
fulltxt.tech_support = Support Email should point to an address that forwards a message to two different locations. One of them will be readable by the POP3 User configured below, and the other is used for an archived copy.

You can use this option to redirect an entire virtual directory to one file. For example, to redirect all requests for the /scripts virtual directory to the file Default.htm in the home directory, type /Default.htm in the Redirect To text box and select this option.<p>A directory below this one:<br>Redirects a parent directory to a child directory. For example, to redirect your home directory (designated by /) to a subdirectory named /newhome, type /newhome in the Redirect To text box and select this option. Without this option, the Web server will continually map the parent to itself.<p>A permanent redirection for this resource:<br>Sends the following message to the client: "301 Permanent Redirect." Redirects are considered temporary, and the client browser receives the following message: "302 Temporary Redirect." Some browsers can use the "301 Permanent Redirect" message as the signal to permanently change a URL, such as a bookmark.

skellist.bbs = Its main feature is that "it allows a user to post messages as well as post replies to existing messages. WebBBS keeps track of which messages are posts and which ones are replies and displays them in a hierarchical tree-like fashion. Posts that start new topics are at the top of each tree, and the replies are shown indented beneath the original posts. WebBBS is also fully integrated with the user authentication library discussed above. Additionally, it allows a user to restrict the number of messages through a variety of query mechanisms. The user can conduct a keyword search and display only those messages that satisfy the search. The user can also select a range of dates within which the viewed messages were posted. For example, a user could choose to see only messages posted between 6/1/96 and 6/10/96.

This also makes FormMail a perfect system-wide solution for allowing users form-based user feedback capabilities without the risks of allowing freedom of CGI access.
skellist.guestbook = Extropia's WebGuestbook is "configurable so that you can specify what your guestbook file looks like and how the script-generated responses are displayed. Most of the configuration takes little more than a knowledge of HTML, so it is fairly easy to use. In addition, the user can select a range of posts based on age in days, and choose to see."
